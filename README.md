# Internship
A repository to share and keep my personal codes from the internship updated. Most of the programs, plugins and scripts will be to GIS problems and routines, using PyQGis library when necessary.


## Plugins
Plugins that I made and I feel I need to share them with the world, possibly they will be released on QGis Official Repository.





*I believe in a Open Source world*
