# Internship
A repository to share and keep my personal codes from the internship updated. Most of the programs, plugins and scripts will be to GIS problems and routines, using PyQGis library when necessary.


## Plugins
Plugins that I made and I feel I need to share them with the world, possibly they will be released on QGis Official Repository.

## Scripts
Scripts for personal and professional purposes, generally automated solutions and solving problems. (Be mind to update paths and functions)

## tools_car
Module to support a company project. It has function and classes to generate and fix drainage vectors, creating of grids, and other similar tasks.

*I believe in a Open Source world*
