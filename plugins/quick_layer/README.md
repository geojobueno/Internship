<h3>Quick Layer!</h3>
A QGIS plugin built with Plugin Builder 3!

The Quick Layer is a simple and useful plugin which save time while you need to digitalize or check two or more layers (included rasters!)
    
You just need to choose a key to make the new shortcut (Ex.: F, 1, P, Ctrl+1) and set the 2 layers you want to turn on canvas.
When necessary the plugin will send a message on python terminal, in general with a command.
